                        <p>Activists had organised five days of Pride events, but in a statement on Monday, Tbilisi Pride said local authorities had "not only failed to secure safety of the queer community and our supporters, but actively hampered us from exercising the right of assembly" ahead of the planned march.</p>

                        <p>At least 20 journalists were reportedly injured in the violence, while an LGBT rainbow flag was burned in the street.</p>

                        <p>It can be difficult to believe that you deserve love and happiness when you’ve been hurt, so start with self-love. Consider integrating some powerful affirmations of self-love into your day. These will help you internalize the fact that you are valuable and lovable, no matter what. Once you start to accept this, it will become easier to open yourself up to love again.</p>

In general, LGBTQ adolescents and young adults have higher levels of depression, suicide attempts, and substance use than those of their heterosexual peers. However, a key protective factor is family acceptance and support. By encouraging families to modify and change behaviors that are experienced by their LGBTQ children as rejecting and to engage in supportive and affirming behaviors, providers can help families to decrease risk and promote healthy outcomes for LGBTQ youth and young adults.</p>
